        "question": "*   Why did you choose to study Computer Science at XYZ University?\n*   Describe a challenging concept you learned during your Computer Science degree and how you overcame that challenge.\n*   How has your education at XYZ University prepared you for the challenges of this role?",
        "answer": "lab session",
        "rating": "**Rating:** 1/10\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis answer is completely inadequate and fails to address any part of the question. It provides a single, contextless phrase (\"lab session\") that offers no insight into the candidate's motivations, experiences, or preparedness. It doesn't explain why they chose XYZ University, describe a challenging concept, or connect their education to the requirements of the role. It's essentially a non-answer."
